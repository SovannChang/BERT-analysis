# Background
### Conceptual Background
Feature-based approach vs. Fine-tuning approach
  - In a feature-based approach, model A is trained, and its representations are used as an input to model B, which is downstream from model A.
  - In a fine-tuning approach, model A is trained, and model B (downstream from A) is refined by tweaking model A's parameters, adjusting the entire system.

### Transformers Before BERT
Before BERT, there were two types of transformers:

  - Models like OpenAI GPT were powerful, but only used unidirectional attention, meaning that the target token could only get context from tokens preceding OR following it - not both.
  - Models like ELMo separately trained forward (left to right) and backward (right to left) unidirectional language models, concatenating their representations of the target token after training. This allowed the target token to attend to tokens before and after it, but was twice as expensive as a single model, and only provided a shallow representation of the token.

### How BERT Surpasses These Models
BERT incorporates a Masked Language Model (MLM) into its pre-training. The MLM randomly masks some of the input tokens and tries to predict the missing tokens from the surrounding context. This allows the model to use context from both sides of the target token when making predictions. BERT also uses Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) as a part of its pre-training.

### The Inner Workings of BERT
BERT's framework consists of two steps. The first is pre-training, done on unlabeled data over different tasks. In the second step, the BERT model is initialized with the pre-trained parameters, and all of the parameters are altered using labeled data from the downstream tasks. Each downstream task has separate models, even though they are initialized with the same pre-trained parameters.

### QUESTION: Is this second step a feature-based approach, or a fine-tuning approach?

### Architecture
BERT uses near-identical architecture for the pre-trained model and downstream models. 
BERT has two main model sizes: 
  - BERT base 
    - 12 transformer layers, 768-dimensional hidden vector, 12 attention heads
    - 110 million parameters
  - BERT large 
    - 24 transformer layers, 1024-dimensional hidden vector, 16 attention heads 
    - 340 million parameters

### Inputs
The entire input is represented as one sequence. Different sentences (e.g. question/answer) are separated using the [SEP] token. Learned embeddings that represent which sentence the token is in are added to the tokens.
    
### Pre-Training
As stated above, BERT is trained on a Masked Language Model and Next Sentence Prediction

##### Data
There are two primary datasets used in pre-training:
- BooksCorpus contains around 800 million words
- English Wikipedia contains around 2.5 billion words
  - Only the article text is used. not headers, lists, tables, etc.

It is importatnt to use document-level data instead of "shuffled sentence-level" data because it allows the model "to extract long, contiguous sequences."

###### MLM
The MLM randomly sets aside 15% of the input tokens. Because fine-tuning won't involve [MASK] tokens, the selected tokens are not all replaced with [MASK] tokens in order to reduce the mismatch between the tasks. Of the 15% set aside, 80% are replaced by [MASK], 10% are replaced by a random token, and 10% are unchanged. The advantage of this is that the transformer does not know which words have been replaced, so it cannot discard any token representations. After the tokens are replaced, the hidden vectors are used to predict the original tokens.

###### NSP
